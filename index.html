        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>
            Imagine you are using a new blow dryer for the first time. It's just a blow dryer you may think. Well, it's not that simple.
            A new blow dryer has various components, for instance buttons and layouts, that may be unlike any you have ever touched.
            <br> 
            <br>
            For instance, imagine interacting with this blow dryer for the first time of your life:

            <br>
            In this particular hair dryer, it consists of various components that are commonly founded on various hair dryers.
            Let's see how people interact with this Gem hair dryer. Time to test!
            <br>
        </h3>
        
        <h2>Observations of Test</h2>
        <h3>
            User 1:
        </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plugged in the hair dryer into an electrical outlet immediately</li>
                <li>Couldn’t get the power to flow to the hair dryer and accordingly pressed various buttons / switches. Made confused expressions.</li>
                <li>They then realized there was a red button on the plug</li>
                <li>Pressed the switches in various directions while aiming the dryer at their head</li>
            </ul>
            User 1 was stuck on the red button concern for quite some time but was able to realize they needed to press on it after randomly every button on the dryer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
            User 2:
        </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plugged in the dryer into an electrical outlet and immediately pressed the red button</li>
                <li>Turned both switches to power 3 and pressed the cool air button a number of times while aiming the dryer at their head</li>
                <li>Very confident demeanor</li>
            </ul>
            In reflection, compared to both other users, user 2 was very certain of all his selections while using the hair dryer. He pressed the button immediately, which thereby passed in the electrical current to the dryer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
            User 3:
        </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plugged dryer into an electrical outlet</li>
                <li>Tried pressing the cool air button and requested help from others since no air was coming out</li>
                <li>Was told they had to press the red button the cord</li>
                <li>Was subsequently very confident with the hair dryer and aimed it at their head while pressing the switches to power 3</li>
            </ul>
            User 3 did not notice that there were buttons on the power cord. They merely pressed the buttons and switches on the hair dryer’s handle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Questions for Users</h2>
            <p>
                Having observed the users, it is only normal procedure to ask them about their reasonings for certain actions. Users were asked the following:
                <br>
                <b>1.  How much prior knowledge did you have with the interfce? (Am an expert, know a little, or know nothing)</b>
                <br>
                All users claimed they were experts.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>2. What did you notice first about the interface?</b>
                <br>
                User 1 and User 3 noticed the switches on the hair dryer’s handle first. User 2 noticed the red button on the power cord first.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>3. How would did you approach the interface? Why did you navigate to [X]?</b>
                <br>
                User 1 and User 3 claimed they approached the buttons on the handle first because their previous experiences with air dryer’s compelled them to. User 2 said the red button stood out them which spurred them to press it after plugging the cord into the power outlet.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>4. How was your experience as you were using the interface? Was it easy or hard to navigate?</b>
                <br>
                User 1 and User 2 rated the experience as very easy and enjoyed the “frictionless” experience. User 3 criticized the red button’s presence on the power cord and said it was unnecessary. They claimed the dryer was mostly easy to navigate, other than the red button.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>5. What did you like about the interface?</b>
                <br>
                They all claimed they liked the numbers on the heat and air power switches as they helped them discern the strength of those values. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>6. What did you not like about the interface?</b>
                <br>
                Users 1 and User 3 did not like the red button on the power cord. All users didn’t like how they couldn’t differentiate which switch was pertaining to heat and which one was pertaining to air strength. They had to play around with it.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>7. What were your thoughts on the design / layout?</b>
                <br>
                User 1 and User 2 suggested adding a sun icon above the heat switch and a wind icon above the wind power switch. User 3 suggested the removal of the red button on the power cord completely.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>8. On a scale of 1-5, how likely are you recommend this interface to someone?</b>
                <br>
                User 1 said 4.75. User 2 said 4.99. User 3 said 4.
