                    <li>Plugged in the hair dryer into an electrical outlet immediately</li>
                    <li>Couldnâ€™t get the power to flow to the hair dryer and accordingly pressed various buttons / switches. Made confused expressions.</li>
                    <li>They then realized there was a red button on the plug</li>
                    <li>Pressed the switches in various directions while aiming the dryer at their head</li>
                </ul>
                User 1 was stuck on the red button concern for quite some time but was able to realize they needed to press on it after randomly every button on the dryer.
