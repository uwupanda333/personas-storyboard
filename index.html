            <br>

        <h2>Observations of Test</h2>
        <h3>
                User 1:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plugged in the hair dryer into an electrical outlet immediately</li>
                    <li>Couldn’t get the power to flow to the hair dryer and accordingly pressed various buttons / switches. Made confused expressions.</li>
                    <li>They then realized there was a red button on the plug</li>
                    <li>Pressed the switches in various directions while aiming the dryer at their head</li>
                </ul>
                User 1 was stuck on the red button concern for quite some time but was able to realize they needed to press on it after randomly every button on the dryer.
                
                User 2:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plugged in the dryer into an electrical outlet and immediately pressed the red button</li>
                    <li>Turned both switches to power 3 and pressed the cool air button a number of times while aiming the dryer at their head</li>
                    <li>Very confident demeanor</li>
                </ul>
                In reflection, compared to both other users, user 2 was very certain of all his selections while using the hair dryer. He pressed the button immediately, which thereby passed in the electrical current to the dryer.

                User 3:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plugged dryer into an electrical outlet</li>
                    <li>Tried pressing the cool air button and requested help from others since no air was coming out</li>
                    <li>Was told they had to press the red button the cord</li>
                    <li>Was subsequently very confident with the hair dryer and aimed it at their head while pressing the switches to power 3</li>
                </ul>
                User 3 did not notice that there were buttons on the power cord. They merely pressed the buttons and switches on the hair dryer’s handle.
